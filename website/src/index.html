                        Time to Leave is a Desktop app for work time management, looking similar to a time-card system.
                        It’s
                        different from other software available as it’s very simple, doesn’t require any database
                        configuration, and focuses on allowing you to control your time. Its premise is to help you
                        manage
                        the time you are working and to notify you when it’s time to leave (therefore the name).
