                    Time to Leave is a Desktop app for work time management, looking similar to a time-card system. It’s
                    different from other software available as it’s very simple, doesn’t require any database
                    configuration, and focuses on allowing you to control your time. Its premise is to help you manage
                    the time you are working and to notify you when it’s time to leave (therefore the name).
